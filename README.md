# 📊 Graph Storytelling Format for Data Analysts

## 🧠 What’s Inside

This repository contains:

- ✅ **MS Word Template** – A modular storytelling format for graphs with and without hue
- ✅ **PDF Version** – Ready-to-share format for presentations and documentation

## ✨ Why Use This Format?

Most graphs fail not because of poor data—but because they lack a story. This format helps you:

- Highlight key insights with clarity
- Compare categories using hue-based segmentation
- Recommend actionable decisions
- Maintain consistency across platforms

## 📘 Supported Graph Types

- Bar charts (grouped, stacked)
- Line charts (single and multi-series)
- Pie charts
- Scatter plots
- Seaborn visuals with `hue`
- Power BI visuals with segments

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Open the **MS Word** or **PDF** file.
2. Replace placeholders like `[X-Axis]`, `[Y-Axis]`, `[Hue Category]`, etc.
3. Use the format in dashboards, reports, or presentations.
